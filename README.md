### Marian is the Product Owner envisioning a project for a new release of her product. She made a projection of a release date based upon a sustained velocity of 17 completed units of work per Sprint. Over the first 3 Sprints, the average velocity was 13 for work that the Development Team estimated as 90% done. The Development Teams, feeling the need to meet the plan, figured that a velocity of 17 was within their reach. A good way to continue is:

- [x] The Development Team makes sure that all of the selected scope per Sprint is as "Done" as possible. The undone work is estimated and added to the Sprint Backlog of the next Sprint, so it doesn't mess up the Product Backlog.
- [ ] Add enough people to the Development Team for the deadline to be made.
- [ ] The opportunity to inspect and adapt is lost. Opaqueness has replaced transparency. Predictability has dropped below zero. The produced software is not usable. As the rules of Scrum have not been respected, it is the Scrum Master's duty to assess whether repair is possible, or a restart with a more reliable team. If not, the Scrum Master should cancel the project.

### You have six teams using a traditional method to deliver a product. Your management has asked you to start using Scrum. In the initial project there were separate plans and teams for the layers of a software system, i.e. one for the frontend, one for the middle tier, one for the back-end, and one for the interfaces and services. This resembles what is known as component teams. But you have read that it's a good idea to have teams organized by feature. What are the advantages of keeping component teams while starting Scrum?

- [x] There's less initial disruption than organizing into new teams. As they start, they will discover what works best, and how to potentially re-organize towards this.
